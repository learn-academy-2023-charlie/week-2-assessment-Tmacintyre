# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.
 
1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: I like to look at a parameter as sort of a placeholder/descriptor of what we want our input as. The argument is the actual live data being passed into per say a function.

Researched answer: A parameter is a variable that takes place as a functions definition, whereas the argument is what gets put in place of the parameter as actual data for the function to use.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: The predefined parameters are value, index, and array with only the value required and index and array as optional.

Researched answer: The parameters are value, index, and array allowing the function to have 3 available arguements while iterating throughout an array to form a new arraw of the same length that meets the set arguments.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: Using map an array of the same length as the original is returned once its conditions are met, while using filter will return a subset of the original array with its new conditions met.

Researched answer: Map allows you to iterate through an array and make changes to the arrays original elements, while filter allows you to iterate though an array without making changes the to the original elements to in turn giving you a subset of the original array with only elements that meet the new conditions.

1. What is iteration?

Your answer: An iteration is the process of repeatedly performing a set of commands until a certain condition is met.

Researched answer: Iteration allows for certain code to be executed for each piece of data in collections such as arrays and objects. Very similiar to looping however iteration does not require a condition to be met for the code to stop executing which looping does require.

1. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: A function allows you to to create dynamic and reusable code that returns an expected output. Methods are a type of function used in in connection with objects and I assume classes as well since classes return objects.

Researched answer: A function is code that serves a set purpose and can be reused. Methods are actual functions being defined in an object. To call a function you perform a function call and pass an argument through its parameters while a method call is performed using dot notation on a defined variable using the objects name. Both are used to perform a particular purpose.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: No idea 

Researched answer: Hoisting is default behavior within JavaScript that relocates all of your declarations to the top of their scope before the programmed code executes. Good practice is to always declare your variables at the top of the scope to avoid common errors regardless if local or global.
## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Component: A component is a piece of code that is reusable similiar to a function, however, unlike a function the returned output is in the form of HTML.

2. Spread operator: A spread operator is basically a shortcut to copy portions of objects and/or arrays and place them into a new object or array.

3. React state: React state is a built in object that can hold bits on information that have the potential to change overtime and is an occurance of a React component class.

4. React props: Similar to a function in js and attributes in html, React props act as an argument within a component. These props also can be used to pass data as a parameter. Unlike its state counterpart, React props cannot have their value changed. 

5. DOM events: DOM events allow your JavaScript code to run when the user interacts with the UI through HTML for example: Changes when you run your curser over an HTML element, when users input information using key strokes, etc.
